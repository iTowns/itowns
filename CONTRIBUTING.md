# How to contribute

Thanks for taking interest in iTowns !

In addition to contributing to the iTowns code, we appreciate many types of
contributions as well:

* Being active on the iTowns mailing lists (see above) by answering questions
  and providing input on iTowns' direction.
* Showcasing your application built with iTowns : submit an issue with a link to
  your demo on the [iTowns website
  repository](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns.github.io/issues). Tag it with
  the `demo` label.
* Writing tutorials, creating examples, and improving the reference
  documentation. See the issues labeled
  [doc](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/labels/doc).
* Submitting issues as [described below](#submitting-an-issue).
* Triaging issues. Browse the [issues](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/issues)
  and comment on issues that are no longer reproducible or on issues for which
  you have additional information.

If you don't know what to do but still want to contribute, check:

* Issues labeled [beginner](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/labels/beginner)
* Issues labeled [help_wanted](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/label/help_wanted)


## Submitting an Issue

If you think you've found a bug in iTowns, first search the [iTowns
issues](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/issues). If an issue already exists,
you can add a comment with any additional information. Use reactions (not
comments) to express your interest. This helps prioritize issues.

If a related issue does not exist, submit a new one. Please include as much of
the following information as is relevant:
* Sample data to reproduce the issue.
* Screenshot, video or animated .gif if appropriate (try
  [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/)). Screenshots are particularly
  useful for exceptions and rendering artifacts. If it is a rendering artifact,
  also include the output of [webglreport.com](http://webglreport.com/) for the
  computer you have the problem on.
* Link to the thread if this was discussed on the iTowns mailing list or
  elsewhere.
* Your operating system and version, browser and version, and video card. Are
  they all up-to-date? Is the issue specific to one of them ?
* The exact version of iTowns. Did this work in a previous version ?
* Ideas for how to fix or workaround the issue. Also mention if you are willing
  to help fix it. If so, the iTowns team can often provide guidance and the
  issue may get fixed more quickly with your help.


## Ask a question, suggest an improvement

If you have a question or a suggestion not related to a bug iTowns, you can search the
[iTowns discussions](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/discussions). If a discussion about
your question or suggestion already exists, you can add a comment or upvote the original
comment in the discussion. Otherwise, you can create a new discussion, detailing your
question or suggestion.

We recommend the use of [iTowns discussions](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/discussions)
for suggestions and questions.
However, there is another way of suggesting imrpovements or asking questions, which is
through iTowns mailing lists. There is a user mailing list and a developer mailing list.

You can subscribe to the mailing lists here:

* Developer: https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/itowns-dev
* User: https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/itowns-user

The mailing list archives are here:

* Developer: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/itowns-dev/
* User: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/itowns-user/

If you cannot find any information on your problem in the archive, you can start
a new thread by sending an email to the list, and someone will probably answer
with a solution.



## Fixing a bug, developing a feature or coding something

You are more than welcome to develop to iTowns, may it be a fix, a new feature,
documentation, or even a typo in a comment. For more information on the setup to
for developing, follow the [Coding guide](CODING.md).

## Opening a Pull Request

We welcome pull requests with great interest. We try to promptly review them,
provide feedback, and merge. Following the tips in this guide will help your
pull request be merged quickly.

If you plan to make a major change, please open an issue first. Pull requests
for small features and bug fixes can generally just be opened without much
discussion.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Code quality matters. Here are some advices to read before submitting a Pull
Request.

* Verify your code passes the linter and tests (`npm run test`). See the
  [Testing guide](CODING.md#Testing).
* Write meaningful commit messages, by following the [Angular
  convention](https://github.com/bcoe/conventional-changelog-standard/blob/master/convention.md).
* Keep the git history clean, rebase your work on the `master` branch of this
  repository.
* If this is your first contribution to iTowns, add your name to
  [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).
* If your pull request fixes an existing issue, include a link to the issue in
  the description. Likewise, if your pull request fixes an issue reported on the
  iTowns mailing list, include a link to the thread in the list archive.
* If your pull request needs additional work, add the `in progress` label,
  include a [task list](https://github.com/blog/1375%0A-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments),
  or better, split it in several PR.
* If you added new identifiers to the iTowns API:
   * Include reference documentation with code examples.
   * If your change adds significant features, provide a demo.
* If you added third-party libraries, including new version of existing
  libraries, update [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md). If you plan to add a third-party
  library, start a new issue first.
