The goal of this tutorial is to give an example on how to use iTowns to visualize data that are in [RGF93 / Lambert-93](https://epsg.io/2154) Coordinate Reference System (CRS).
We will display a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and layer ortho-images from the 
[French Geoportail](https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr) API on it.

## Preparing the webpage

The webpage we want to display data on should be structured as follows :
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Display a planar view with iTowns</title>
        <style>
            html { height: 100%; }
            body { margin: 0; overflow: hidden; height: 100%; }
            #viewerDiv { margin: auto; height: 100%; width: 100%; padding: 0; }
            canvas { display: block }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="viewerDiv"></div>
        <script src="../dist/itowns.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            // Tutorial code should go here
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

What we are doing here is fairly simple :
- we create a container `<div id="viewerDiv"></div>` that will contain the 3D view ;
- we define the layout of this container within our webpage ;
- we import iTowns framework (which in our case is imported from the `dist/` repository).

We will then add javascript to use iTowns to display data within a `<script>` markup following iTowns import.

To work as is, this web page should be placed in the `examples/` folder of [itowns](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns) but you can put it anywhere else as 
long as you have a local web server and that you adapt the link to itowns (`<script src="../dist/itowns.js"></script>`).

## Create a view

As mentioned in [fundamentals tutorial]{@tutorial Fundamentals}, we need a `{@link View}` to support any geographic data we wish to display.
What we want here is to display data in a RGF93 / Lambert-93 projection, which is a conic local projection. 
Therefore, we should use a `{@link PlanarView}`, which is a specific type of `View` adapted to local projections.
We can create it as such :

```js
const viewerDiv = document.getElementById('viewerDiv');

itowns.proj4.defs(
    'EPSG:2154',
    '+proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=44 +lat_0=46.5 +lon_0=3 +x_0=700000 +y_0=6600000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs'
);
const viewExtent = new itowns.Extent(
    'EPSG:2154',
    644500.0, 659499.99,
    6857500.0, 6867499.99,
);

const view = new itowns.PlanarView(viewerDiv, viewExtent);
```

Several things are done here :
- First, we retrieve the `DomElement` relative to the container we created that will contain iTowns visualisation.
- Then we define the geographic extent of our view by instantiating iTowns `{@link Extent}` class.
To do so, we need to pass five argument to `Extent` constructor, which are :
  - The Coordinates Reference System (CRS) of the extent, given as its EPSG code.
    Here, we use [RGF93 / Lambert-93](https://epsg.io/2154) CRS.
    Not all CRS are defined by default within iTowns, which is why we need to define our CRS using [proj4](https://proj.org/) prior to instantiating the `Extent` ;
  - The westernmost, easternmost, southernmost and northernmost coordinates of the extent.
- Finally, we create a `{@link PlanarView}` giving it the required `DomElement` and `Extent` parameters.
    
At this stage, our webpage should look like this : 

![Simple PlanarView](images/Raster-data-Lambert93-1.png)

The blue rectangle you can see is the view we just created.
By default, iTowns positions the camera on top of the view center.
We can change the initial camera position by passing a `[CameraTransformOption]{@link CameraUtils}` object as an optional parameter of `PlanarView` constructor.

To do so, we first need to create our `CameraTransformOption` object :

```js
const placement = {
    coord: viewExtent.center(),
    tilt: 12,
    heading: 40,
    range: 16000,
}
```

We are specifying here that the camera should target the center of the extent, with an azimuth of 40 degrees and a pitch of 12 degrees under the horizontal plane.
The camera should also be at a distance of 16000 meters from its target (i.e. from the view extent center).

We can then just pass this object to the `PlanarView` constructor parameters :

```js
const view = new itowns.PlanarView(viewerDiv, viewExtent, {
    placement: placement,
});
```

Our webpage should now look like this :

![PlanarView with placement](images/Raster-data-Lambert93-2.png)

Now that we have created a view, we will use it to display geographic data.

## Add a color layer

The first data we want to display on our planar surface is ortho-images.
To do so, we must define the source at which ortho-images data can be fetched thanks to the `Source` class. 
We can start displaying ortho-images provided by the [Geoportail](https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr) as such :

```js
const sourceOrtho = new itowns.WMSSource({
    url: "https://wxs.ign.fr/inspire/inspire/r/wms",
    name: "OI.OrthoimageCoverage.HR",
    format: 'image/png',
    crs: 'EPSG:2154',
    extent: viewExtent,
});
const layerOrtho = new itowns.ColorLayer('Ortho', { source: sourceOrtho });
view.addLayer(layerOrtho);
```

In this code, we first define the source specifications of the data we wish to fetch. 
`{@link WMSSource}` has several mandatory parameters :
- the server `url`, the `name` of the data and their `format`, which are used to generate the final `url` at which data shall be fetched ;
- the CRS of the fetched data ;
- the geographic extent of the resources (set here as the extent of the view).

Then we create a `{@link ColorLayer}` from two parameters : a unique `id` for the layer (`Ortho`) as well as the `Source` instance for the layer data.

Finally, we add the created layer to the view with `view.addLayer(layerOrtho);`.

The result we get at this stage is the following, where we can see the newly added ortho-imagery layer :

![Ortho layer](images/Raster-data-Lambert93-3.png)

## Add an elevation layer

The process of adding an `{@link ElevationLayer}` is similar to what we just did with the `ColorLayer`. 
At first, we need to define the source of the elevation raster data.
Then we can simply create the `ElevationLayer`, giving it a unique `id` and the source configuration, and finally adding it to the view.

```js
const sourceDEM = new itowns.WMSSource({
    url: "https://wxs.ign.fr/altimetrie/geoportail/r/wms",
    name: "ELEVATION.ELEVATIONGRIDCOVERAGE.HIGHRES",
    format: "image/x-bil;bits=32",
    crs: 'EPSG:2154',
    extent: viewExtent,
});
const layerDEM = new itowns.ElevationLayer('DEM', { source: sourceDEM });
view.addLayer(layerDEM);
```

The result is shown bellow. 
The camera has been zoomed in to get a more precise rendering of the elevation variations, which are not very important on the extent we chose to display.

## Result

With this tutorial, we have learnt how to use iTowns `ColorLayer` and an `ElevationLayer` to display data in a local conic projection. 
The code that is shown bellow sums up all the steps it took to do so.
