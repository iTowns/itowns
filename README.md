## What is it?

iTowns is a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)-based framework written in Javascript/WebGL for visualizing 3D geospatial data.

It can connect to WMS/WMTS/TMS servers including elevation data and load many different data formats (3dTiles, GPX, KML and much much more).

## How to use Itowns in your project

You can use it through npm (the preferred way) or download a bundle from our github release page.

### With NPM

In your project:

```bash
npm install --save itowns
```
This package contains the ES5-compatible sources of Itowns.

If you're using a module bundler (like wepback), you can directly `require('itowns')` in your code.

Alternatively, we provide a bundle you can directly include in your html files that exposes `itowns` in  `window`:
```html
<script src="node_modules/itowns/dist/itowns.js"></script>
```

**/!\ Please note that this bundle also contains the dependencies**.

### From a release bundle

See our [release page](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/releases).


## Supported data types and features

- Imagery from WMTS/WMS/TMS
- Elevation (DTM/DSM) from WMTS
- 3D Tiles
- ...

See the [feature list wiki page](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns/wiki/Supported-Features) for a complet list of features and data formats.

## Tests

If you want to run tests you'll need to install [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).

If you install pupperter behind proxy, use HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY, NO_PROXY to defines HTTP proxy settings that are used to download and run Chromium.

If puppeteer fails to download Chrome, you can try with the [documented environment variables](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#environment-variables).
Or you can download it manually, and then:
- install puppeteer without downloading Chrome: `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install puppeteer`
- then use the env var `CHROME` to tell itowns/mocha/puppeteer what Chrome app it should use:
`CHROME=/opt/google/chrome-beta/chrome npm run test-examples`

Then you can run the tests:
```bash
npm run test-examples
```
Supported environment variables:

    * SCREENSHOT_FOLDER: take a screenshot at the end of each test and save it in this folder. Example: SCREENSHOT_FOLDER=/tmp/
    * CHROME: path to Chrome executable. If unspecified itowns will use the one downloaded during puppeteer install.
    * DEBUG: run Chrome in a window with the debug tools open.
    * REMOTE_DEBUGGING: run Chrome in headless mode and set up remote debugging. Example: REMOTE_DEBUGGING=9222 will setup remote debugging on port 9222. Then start another Chrome instance, browse to chrome://inspect/#devices and add localhost:9222 in Discover network targets.

Note: Chrome in headless mode doesn't support the WebGL EXT_frag_depth extension. So rendering may differ and some bugs can only be present in headless mode.
