# iTowns V2

## What is it?

iTowns is a [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)-based framework written in Javascript/WebGL for visualizing 3D geospatial data.

It can connect to WMS/WMTS/TMS servers including elevation data and load many different data format (3dTiles, gpx, KML and much much more).

The V2 of iTowns Open Source is a refactoring of [iTowns V1](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns-legacy).

## How to use Itowns in your project

You can use it through npm (the preferred way) or download a bundle from our github release page.

### With NPM

In your project:

```bash
npm install --save itowns
```
This package contains the ES5-compatible sources of Itowns.

If you're using a module bundler (like wepback), you can directly `require('itowns')` in your code.

Alternatively, we provide a bundle you can directly include in your html files that exposes `itowns` in  `window`:
```html
<script src="node_modules/itowns/dist/itowns.js"></script>
```

**/!\ Please note that this bundle also contains the dependencies**.
