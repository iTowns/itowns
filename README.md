# iTowns V2

## What is it?

iTowns is a web framework written in Javascript/WebGL for visualisation of 3D geographic data allowing precise measurements in 3D.
Its first purpose was the visualisation of street view images and terrestrial lidar point cloud. It has then been extended to handle more data types.

The V2 of iTowns Open Source is a refactoring of [iTowns V1](https://github.com/iTowns/itowns)

This version includes a globe visualization mode.

## How to use Itowns in your project

You can use it through npm (the preferred way) or download a bundle from our github release page.

### With NPM

In your project:

```bash
npm install --save itowns
```
This package contains the ES5-compatible sources of Itowns.

If you're using a module bundler (like wepback), you can directly `require('itowns')` in your code.

Alternatively, we provide a bundle you can directly include in your html files that exposes `itowns` in  `window`:
```html
<script src="node_modules/itowns/dist/itowns.js"></script>
```

**/!\ Please note that this bundle also contains the dependencies**.
